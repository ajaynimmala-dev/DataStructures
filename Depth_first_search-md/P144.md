Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

# Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,2,3]

Output: [1,2,3]

Explanation:

# Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,8,null,null,6,7,9]

Output: [1,2,4,5,6,7,3,8,9]

Explanation:

# Example 3:

Input: root = []

Output: []

# Example 4:

Input: root = [1]

Output: [1]
